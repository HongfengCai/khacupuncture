    <p>Both acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been used successfully for many thousands of years in the treatment of a wide range of conditions. By inserting a number of very fine needles into specific points along a system of energy pathyways or meridians, the acupuncturist endeavours to restore balance on every level. Because acupuncture works on the whole body, change can be generated emotionally as well as physically.</p>
